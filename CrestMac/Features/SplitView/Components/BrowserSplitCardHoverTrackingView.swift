import AppKit

/// A transparent view that reports where the pointer is while it is inside its
/// bounds: as it arrives, and as it moves.
///
/// SwiftUI's `.onHover` is not usable here: a card's content is a `WKWebView`, and
/// hover callbacks over live web content arrive late, arrive once, or do not
/// arrive at all depending on what the page does with the pointer. An
/// `NSTrackingArea` is answered by AppKit's own tracking machinery instead of by
/// the view under the cursor, so it reports the truth regardless of the page.
///
/// The view is inert in every other respect. `hitTest` returns `nil`, so it can
/// sit above live web content — where tracking is most reliable — without taking
/// a single click, scroll, or drag away from the page beneath it.
///
/// `.inVisibleRect` means the tracked region follows the view's visible bounds,
/// so a card that resizes, scrolls, or is clipped by a narrowing window needs no
/// rebuild of its own. `.activeInKeyWindow` keeps a background window from moving
/// focus in the window someone is actually working in.
///
/// Movement is reported as well as arrival because a tracking area answers to
/// geometry alone: it reports the pointer entering a card even when chrome drawn
/// over the card is what the pointer is on. A pointer that arrives on that
/// chrome and then moves off it onto the card never enters again, so it is
/// reported as it moves. The view is flipped, so a location reads from the top
/// like the SwiftUI frames it is compared with.
